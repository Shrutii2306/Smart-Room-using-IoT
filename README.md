# Smart-Room-using-IoT

NEED OF SYSTEM: 
In a world grappling with the challenges of climate change and environmental sustainability, the need for our Solar-Powered Smart Living system with IoT integration becomes increasingly evident. Traditional energy sources contribute to environmental degradation, necessitating a shift towards renewable alternatives.

Our system addresses this need by harnessing solar power intelligently, optimizing energy absorption through dynamic panel tilting. The Smart Room components further contribute by promoting energy-efficient practices and ensuring occupant safety. As urbanization and energy demands rise, the imperative for integrated, eco-friendly solutions becomes paramount. 

Our innovative approach not only meets this demand but also charts a path towards a more sustainable, connected, and secure future for modern living.

DESCRIPTION OF COMPONENTS:

Arduino:
Arduino is an open-source platform used for building electronic projects. It consists of both hardware and software components, making it easy for anyone to create interactive objects or environments. With Arduino, we can create wide range of projects, from simple LED lights to complex robots. In the context of a smart room, Arduino can be used to control various sensors and devices. By programming the Arduino board, you can make the room respond to different stimuli, such as motion or fire.

PIR Sensor:
One of the key features of a smart room is its ability to detect motion. By using sensors such as PIR (Passive Infrared) sensors, Arduino can detect when someone enters or leaves a room. This information can then be used to trigger certain actions, such as turning on the light or fan. Motion detection using Arduino has a wide range of applications, from improving quality of life and optimizing energy consumption. For example, you can program the room to turn off the lights when no one is present, or to turn on the heating system when someone enters the room.

Bluetooth Module:
One of the key features of a smart room is the ability to control various devices through Bluetooth technology. This means that you can easily connect your smartphone or tablet to your smart room and control everything from the lights to the temperature with just a few taps on your device. Not only does this provide increased convenience, but it also allows for greater customization and personalization of your living space.

Fire Sensor:
Another important feature of a smart room is its ability to detect fire. By using heat sensors, Arduino can detect the presence of fire in a room and alert the occupants to the danger. This early warning can be crucial in preventing fires and saving lives. Due to this we can minimize the damage caused by fires and improve overall safety in our homes and workplaces.

Solar panel:
A solar panel is a collection of solar (or photovoltaic) cells, which can be used to generate electricity through photovoltaic effect. A typical solar tracking system adjusts the face of the solar panel or reflective surfaces to align with the sun as it moves across the sky.

LDR sensors:
LDRs are tiny light-sensing devices also known as photo-resistors. An LDR is a resistor whose resistance changes as the amount of light falling on it changes. The resistance of the LDR decreases with an increase in light intensity. 

DC-DC volt converter:
DC-to-DC converters are devices that temporarily store electrical energy for the purpose of converting direct current (DC) from one voltage level to another.

MG90 servo Motor:
A servo motor is a self-contained electrical device that rotates parts of a machine with high efficiency and with great precision. The output shaft of this motor can be moved to a particular angle, position and velocity that a regular motor does not have.
